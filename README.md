In this lab, I performed agent and administrator tasks. I created a employee account (Karen Long). Open New Ticket was selected in the Support Center Ticket System. Through this portal, Karen was able to report an issue to be sent to the helpdesk.

 After the employee's email address, name and issue summary were entered (Entire mobile online banking is down), I clicked create ticket.

I also created a helpdesk agent (Jane Doe) and set her up with access to perform certain tasks within the program.

Every communication is showing in the case. This issue was changed to an emergency as Level 3 Support was 
needed.

<br />
The resolution was notated in the case and Ticket Status was changed to resolved.
